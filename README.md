# Corona-Virus-Analysis

I have collected a dataset on the CORONA VIRUS, which includes information on provinces, countries/regions, latitude, longitude, dates, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Using this dataset, I will answer important questions to derive meaningful insights and understand the virus's spread and impact.

The analysis will be guided by 16 specific questions provided in the reference SQL file. Through this project, I aim to highlight key patterns and trends using SQL queries and data analysis techniques.
